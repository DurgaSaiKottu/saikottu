<title>Dangers of DHMO</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>
<p>
<strong>Dihydrogen monoxide</strong>, also known as <em>hydroxyl acid</em> or
<em>DHMO</em><sup>1</sup>, is a dangerous substance that<sup>2</sup>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>is the major component of acid rain,</li>
<li>contributes to the greenhouse effect,</li>
<li>may cause severe burns,</li>
<li>is fatal if inhaled,</li>
<li>contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape,</li>
<li>accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals,</li>
<li>may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes,</li>
<li>has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>
       Despite the danger, DHMO is often used:
</p>
<ul>
<li>as an industrial solvent and coolant,</li>
<li>in nuclear power plants,</li>
<li>in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>,</li>
<li>as a fire retardant,</li>
<li>in many forms of cruel animal research,</li>
<li>as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products,</li>
<li>in the distribution of pesticides.</li>
</ul>
<p>
       Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
</p>
<p>
<sup>1</sup>The more common chemical formula is H<sub>2</sub>O.<br>
