    <h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Dihydrogen monoxide</strong>, also known as <em>hydroxyl acid</em> or
        <em>DHMO</em>, is a dangerous substance that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.Is the major component of acid rain.</li>
        <li>2.Contributes to the greenhouse effect.</li>
        <li>3.May cause severe burns.</li>
        <li>4.Is fatal if inhaled.</li>
        <li>5.Contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.</li>
        <li>6.Accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.</li>
        <li>7.May cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.</li>
        <li>8.Has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Despite the danger, DHMO is often used:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>as an industrial solvent and coolant.</li>
        <li>in nuclear power plants,</li>
        <li>in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>.</li>
        <li>as a fire retardant,</li>
        <li>in many forms of cruel animal research.</li>
        <li>as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products.</li>
        <li>in the distribution of pesticides.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
